	/// The convergents to a simple continued fraction are in their lowest terms.
	/// Proof.If d divides pm and qm for some m, then d divides pm+1qm − pmqm+1 which is (−1)m	by Theorem. So, pm and qm cannot have any common divisor other than ±1 which	implies all the convergents are in their lowest terms.
